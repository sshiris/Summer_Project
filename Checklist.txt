Learning Checklist (Before Buying)

Phase 1: ESP32 & Arduino IDE
-Install Arduino IDE
-Install ESP32 board package
-Upload "Blink" sketch to ESP32 to confirm setup
-Learn what GPIO pins are and how to use digitalWrite() and delay()

Phase 2: LED Control Basics
-Install FastLED library in Arduino IDE
-Understand WS2812B structure: power, ground, data line
-Learn how addressable LEDs work (each LED has an internal controller)
-Write simple code to set LED colors (e.g., red, green, blue)

Phase 3: Electronics & Power
-Understand why a 330Ω resistor is used on the data line
-Understand why a 1000µF capacitor is placed across power input
-Learn how to use a logic level shifter to convert 3.3V to 5V
-Calculate LED current usage (approx. 60mA per LED at full white)

Phase 4: Sound & FFT
-Understand microphone options (INMP441, MAX9814)
-Learn what FFT is (convert time-domain audio to frequency-domain)
-Explore Arduino FFT libraries (e.g., ArduinoFFT)
-Learn how to sample audio and convert to a frequency-based LED pattern
