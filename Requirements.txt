## User Requirements
1. As a user, I want to control the led through an application.
2. As a user, I want to control the color and frequency based on the music.

## System Requirements
### Hardware
- ESP32 or ESP8266 Microcontroller
- RGB LED Strip(WS2812B-individual addressable)
- Power Supply(depends on the led strip, eg. 5V 10A for a 5v led strip)
- 74AHCT125 or 74HCT245 Logic Level Converter(converts the 3.3V signal from your ESP32 to a true 5V signal the LEDs understand)
- Resistors(330 ohm for data line)
    Purpose:
    It protects the first LED from sudden voltage spikes.
    It improves signal integrity and reduces noise/reflections on the line.
    Where to place:
    Between the ESP32 data pin and the LED strip's DIN pin.
    eg:ESP32 GPIO (e.g., D5) --- [ 330Ω resistor ] --- DIN (LED strip).
- A mix of male-male, male-female, and female-female jumper wires.
- Capacitor(1000uF, 6.3V or higher for power supply)
- Microphone (INMP441, MAX9814, etc. for sound detection)
- External processor or FFT module
- LLC & Power Supply & ESP32 connection

### Software
- Use FastLED(C++ with Arduino IDE) for controlling the LED strip.

##Programming Setup
- Arduino IDE
  Download from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- FastLED Library
  Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
  Search for "FastLED" and install the library.
  Click install
-Install ESP32/ESP8266 Board
  Go to File > Preferences
  Add the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
  Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
  Search for "ESP32" and install the package.

##Programming Workflow
1. Write code in Arduino IDE using FastLED
2. Connect ESP32 to your PC via USB
3. Select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE
4. Upload the sketch to the ESP32
5. See the led strip respond
